## Course Description

This is an Object Oriented programming course with Java. Topics include data encapsulation, inheritance and name spacing. Discover some of the lesser-known, yet useful, features of the language, such as how to debug Java problems from the command line.

We will include basic software testing to confirm correctness and behavoir of programs.

Computers are provided in the lab, though you are encouraged to bring a laptop for in-class exercises.

## Prerequisites
* Good computer skills (ie. can locate folders and use a command line)
* Understanding of variables, data types, control flow, and basic function usage in C
* Basic knowledge of HTML, and at least basics of CSS

These won't be enforced by the instructor, but you will be pretty lost without understanding those concepts. 

Refer to the [beginner material](#beginner-material) for links. 

Refer to [Workflow with Github](#workflow-with-github) if you need help in using git or GitHub.

## Course Overview

We will be learning how to use object oriented concepts to develop solutions that can be modeled into code. We will try to contrast Python with Java if possible. Topics to be covered are:

* Abstraction
* (Class based) Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Overloading and Overriding
* Composition
* Test Driven Development
* Source Versioning
* Basics of Maven

Topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples/slides.  Additional exercises will completed in-class.

## Homework/Projects

All assignments are listed within the [Course Outline](#course-outline).

### Workflow with Github

If you're using GitHub Desktop, these general instructions will help:

* <https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/>
* <https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1>
* <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/>

### Requirements

These apply to real life, as well.

* Must apply "good programming style" learned in class
    * Functions should be "short" (see [Sandi Metz's rules for developers](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)).
    * Optimize for readability.
        * ["Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." -Harold Abelson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9168-programs-must-be-written-for-people-to-read-and-only)
    * For projects, use Object-Oriented Programming (obviously).
* Any borrowed code must be properly [annotated](#instructor).

#### Extra Credit

Bonus points for:

* Creativity (as long as requirements are fulfilled)
* Anything listed under `BONUS` in the README of the exercise.

#### Late Submissions

* Late submissions result in only half credit. 
* Any submission past 3 days the due date result in *NO CREDIT*

#### Work deadlines

* Each Friday 11:59PM is the deadline for each week's class work unless specified
* The checking of work is done against your github account and repo. This is an automated process.

## Course Outline

### Class 1 (Dec 5-9)

1. Setup
    * How many people are comfortable with Git/GitHub?
    * Double check everyone has signed up
    * Install Git (if needed)
        * If you are comfortable with Git already, you can skip this.

2. Main Excercise
    * Git basics (with Github)

Note: Due to lack of time, I didn't get to cover other key github concepts like:
    
    * Forking
    * Pushing and pulling from a remote repository (This is related to forking)

You'll have to learn this on your own. Please refer to the github guides in the [Github](#github) section of this syllabus.

#### Homework

* [Set up your GitHub profile.](https://github.com/settings/profile)
    * Add a proper picture so I can identify you
    * Use your real name 
    * In your Bio should contain you STUDENT ID number
* [Join the COE11-USTP-CEA org](https://github.com/COE11-USTP-CEA)

* [Perform Work1 Assignment](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/dc7559eb8245a5fd0c783f6458efcfe7)
    * Work1 Assigned uses the [student_gpa_java](https://github.com/COE11-USTP-CEA/student_gpa_java) repo
    * This is a 0 or 10 kind of assignment.

### Class 2 (Dec 12-16)

1. Introduce [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) so we can download Java libraries from the internet
2. Introduce [testing using TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/index.html) which we get via Maven

#### Homework

* Perform [Mkyong's TestNG's tutorial](http://www.mkyong.com/tutorials/testng-tutorials/)
    * Do the first 3 tutorials at least
* Add test to [student_gpa_java](https://github.com/COE11-USTP-CEA/student_gpa_java) repo. 
    * This work is scored on a 0-10 scale. 
    * Score is based on results of test and timeliness of submission.

## Pairing Tips

* Three people is possible, but two works best
* Agree on an editor and environment that you're both comfortable with
* The person who's less experienced/comfortable should have more keyboard time
* Switch who's "driving" regularly
* Make sure to save the code and send it to both people

## Statements on Plagiarism

### USTP

> USTP takes plagiarism very seriously and regards it as a form of fraud.  The definition of plagiarism that has been adopted by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies is as follows: "Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work as though it were one's own.  More specifically, plagiarism is to present as one's own words quoted without quotation marks from another writer; a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work; or facts or ideas gathered, organized, and reported by someone else, orally and/or in writing.  Since plagiarism is a matter of fact, not of the student's intention, it is crucial that acknowledgement of the sources be accurate and complete.  Even where there is not a conscious intention to deceive, the failure to make appropriate acknowledgement constitutes plagiarism.  Penalties for plagiarism range from failure for a paper or course to dismissal from the University.

### Instructor

Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development.  As a programmer you will never (or try not to) write anything from scratch.  This class is structured such that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers.  I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they  are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.

Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.
